# ERP-A/P Project

## Overview
This project is a mock front-end for an ERP system. Please note that the backend has not been developed yet, so all the functions in this project are non-operational at this time. Additionally, validation has not been implemented and will need to be addressed in future development stages.

## Important Notes
- **Backend Development**: The backend for this project is not yet developed. As a result, none of the functions in this project will work as expected. It serves purely as a mock front-end interface.
- **Validation**: Validation for forms and inputs has not been implemented. This part still needs to be developed to ensure data integrity and user input validation.

## Workflow

The workflow in this project is designed as follows:
1. **Basic Information**: Users enter basic invoice details such as invoice number, issue date, and due date.
2. **Vendor Information**: Users provide vendor details, including name, address, phone number, and email.
3. **Items**: Users add details about purchased items, including description, quantity, unit price, and total amount.
4. **Payment**: Users review payment details and finalize the invoice.

## Notes

- The project structure was adapted from a previous project due to the author's limited experience in front-end development.
- The author is not very familiar with ERP systems, so there may be inaccuracies or discrepancies in the workflow. Please take this into consideration when reviewing the project.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome as we continue to improve and develop this project.
